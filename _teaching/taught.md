I have been a Graduate Student Instructor at UC Berkeley for 9 semesters and am a recipient of the Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor Award.  This page provides a list of the courses I have been a Graduate Student Instructor for.


Physics 8B: Introductory Physics (3 times)
======
Introduction to electricity, magnetism, electromagnetic waves, optics, and modern physics. The course presents concepts and methodologies for understanding physical phenomena, and is particularly useful preparation for upper division study in biology and architecture.

I have taught this class both in-person and fully remote.  Comments from my students during Spring 2020 (a semester when I taught out of a barn over zoom due to the abrupt transition to remote learning) can be viewed [here:](http://benlfoster.github.io/files/For_Ben.pdf)

Physics 7C: Physics for Scientists and Engineers (1 time)
======
Electromagnetic waves, optics, relativity, and quantum physics.

Physics 105: Analytic Mechanics (3 times)
======
Newtonian mechanics, motion of a particle in one, two, and three dimensions, Lagrangeâ€™s equations, Hamilton's equations, central force motion, moving coordinate systems, mechanics of continuous media, oscillations, normal modes, rigid body dynamics, tensor analysis techniques. Some knowledge of Python required for homework assignments. 

Physics C21: Physics and Music (1 time)
======
What can we learn about the nature of reality and the ways that we humans have invented to discover how the world works? An exploration of these questions through the physical principles encountered in the study of music. The applicable laws of mechanics, fundamentals of sound, harmonic content, principles of sound production in musical instruments, musical scales.

Physics C10: Descriptive Introduction to Physics (1 time)
======
Topics covered include energy and conservation, radioactivity, nuclear physics, the Theory of Relativity, lasers, explosions, earthquakes, superconductors, and quantum physics.


Physics Directed Reading Program (5 times)
====
The Physics DRP is an unofficial graduate student-led semester-long reading course in which a graduate student and undergraduate identify a topic of interest and read through a textbook or series of papers together.  I have led reading programs on biophysics, dynamical systems, and fluid dynamics and spent roughly 2 hours in preparation and 2 hours in discussion per week every semester.
