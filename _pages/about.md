I am a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford working in the Prakash Lab.  Previously, I did my Ph.D. in the Physics department at UC Berkeley under Professor Edgar Knobloch working at the intersection of nonlinear dynamics, elasticity, and biophysics.

Research
======
<br/><img src='/images/wrinkles_low.png'>
My research centers on the nonlinear response of thin elastic membranes on a springy substrate to applied loads.  This basic system has broad relevance to a host of systems in biology and fluid dynamics such as arteries and airways and provides an exciting testbed for analyzing wrinkling and folding responses.
